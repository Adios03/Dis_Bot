# Dis_Bot
Discord Bot using Python

In these Project, I have created a Discord Bot and hosted it on the Discord Server with the help of Discord package in Python and by using the OpenAI API Keys. The Bot uses the GPT-3.5 model to respond to the messages on the server and has been given the access of OpenAI and its API Keys etc.
